1. Problem Definition
The Employee Records program is designed to maintain employee information. It provides functionalities such as adding, deleting, modifying, searching, displaying all records, and counting records. The data is stored in a text file and remains accessible across program executions. The program also includes proper validation of data fields and ensures the uniqueness of employee numbers.




2. Algorithms
The following algorithms are used to implement the functionalities of the Employee Records program:
- ADD: This algorithm adds a new employee record to the file.
- DELETE: This algorithm removes an existing employee record from the file.
- MODIFY: This algorithm updates the information of an existing employee record in the file.
- SEARCH: This algorithm searches for an employee record based on the provided criteria (First Name, Last Name, or Department).
- Display All Records: This algorithm retrieves and displays all employee records from the file.
COUNT: This algorithm counts and returns the total number of employee records in the file.
